Thanks to Mark for his awesome answer! Expanding on that a little:

```osascript
# Look up the parent of the given PID.
# From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3586888/how-do-i-find-the-top-level-parent-pid-of-a-given-process-using-bash
function get-top-parent-pid () {
    PID=${1:-$$}
    PARENT=$(ps -p $PID -o ppid=)

    # /sbin/init always has a PID of 1, so if you reach that, the current PID is
    # the top-level parent. Otherwise, keep looking.
    if [[ ${PARENT} -eq 1 ]] ; then
        echo ${PID}
    else
        get-top-parent-pid ${PARENT}
    fi
}

function bring-window-to-top () {
    osascript<<EOF
    tell application "System Events"
        set processList to every process whose unix id is ${1}
        repeat with proc in processList
            set the frontmost of proc to true
        end repeat
    end tell
EOF
}
```

You can then run:

```
bring-window-to-top $(get-top-parent-pid)
```
Quick test using:
```
sleep 5; bring-window-to-top $(get-top-parent-pid)
```
And swap to something else. After 5 seconds the terminal running your script will be sent to the top.
