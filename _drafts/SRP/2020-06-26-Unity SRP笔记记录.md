## 比较特殊的几个方法记录

- buffer.GetTemporaryRT
> public void GetTemporaryRT(int nameID, int width, int height, int depthBuffer, FilterMode filter, RenderTextureFormat format, RenderTextureReadWrite readWrite, int antiAliasing, bool enableRandomWrite);
> 
> public void GetTemporaryRT(int nameID, RenderTextureDescriptor desc, FilterMode filter);
>> Add a "get a temporary render texture" command.
>> 
>> This creates a temporary render texture with given parameters, and sets it up as a global shader property with nameID. Use Shader.PropertyToID to create the integer name.
>> 
>> Release the temporary render texture using ReleaseTemporaryRT, passing the same nameID. Any temporary textures that were not explicitly released will be removed after camera is done rendering, or after Graphics.ExecuteCommandBuffer is done.
>> 
>> After getting a temporary render texture, you can set it as active (SetRenderTarget) or blit to/from it (Blit). You do not explicitly need to preserve active render targets during command buffer execution (current render targets are saved & restored afterwards).

## buffer.BeginSample
> 如果是外层包装的话，就算是空buffer也必须执行一次才能在debug界面包围成功
